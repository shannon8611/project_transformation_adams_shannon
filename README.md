## Resources
*  “I did not use any resources outside of the lectures
and my notes on this assignment.”

## Deductions
* I reviewed the list of deductions for this project
and in the syllabus.

## Comments
* For the w3c validation there was one error but I could not find it to fix it.
And for the html5 outliner I was unsure how to correct the outline as well.
It was a long assignment, but Kalehoff's lecture was a good
walk through.
